# 🤖 AI-Driven Business Analysis Portfolio

## 💡 Why This Portfolio Matters  
As AI rapidly transforms how organizations operate, Business Analysts play a critical role in shaping, implementing, and scaling intelligent workflows. This portfolio showcases real-world AI initiatives I've led — not as a developer, but as a Business Analyst deeply involved in business context, stakeholder alignment, and end-to-end solution delivery.

These projects demonstrate how I used GPT and AI tools to automate manual content operations, improve data accuracy, and design prompt-driven solutions that deliver measurable business value.
